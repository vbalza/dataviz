        If you have tried to avoid consuming palm oil—chances are, you haven’t. 
        This ubiquitous product derived from the oil palm tree is found in roughly half of all packaged goods, 
        from chocolate and cleaning agents to biofuels and bread.

          <p class="caption">
            Oil palm is relatively cheap, highly versatile, and efficient to produce, prompting a 
            rise in global production since the 1970s. While it is cultivated in over 40 
            countries—primarily along the equator where high rainfall and steady sunshine prevail—Indonesia and 
            Malaysia dominate the market, generating approximately 85% of the entire supply.

            The proliferation of industrial and smallholder plantations has come at widespread 
            environmental costs. Across regions, producers looking to expand production have 
            encroached upon tropical forests and other habitats, releasing carbon dioxide and 
            other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

          <p class="caption">
            In Southeast Asia, oil palm cultivation has degraded tropical peatlands, swampy ecosystems that store as 
            much as 18 to 28 times more carbon than forests. When drained, peatlands are especially susceptible to 
            fires, which can produce a considerable amount of smoke and other pollutants.
