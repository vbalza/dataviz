        If you have ever tried to avoid consuming palm oil, chances are—you haven't. 
        This ubiquitous product derived from the oil palm tree is found in roughly half of 
        all packaged goods, from chocolate and cleaning agents to biofuels and bread.

            Oil palm is relatively cheap, versatile, and efficient to produce, prompting a 
            rise in global production since the 1970s. While it is cultivated in over 40 
            countries—Indonesia and Malaysia generate approximately 85% of the entire supply.

            As global awareness of the environmental impacts of oil palm production increases, 
            governments and corporations have come under pressure to find alternatives, going as

            consequences for the planet, as it would likely shift demand to less productive oils like 
            rapeseed (i.e., canola), sunflower, and soybean oil.

      <h2>
        A way forward
      </h2>
      <p>
        To replace the world’s growing demand for palm oil through alternative 
        vegetable oils would require substantially more land—and threaten more habitats, 
        species, and communities. This is not to say that the status quo is tenable but 
        rather that the world should focus on the 
        increased sustainability of oil palm cultivation. One possible response is to increase market demand 
        for palm oil certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), 
        which currently comprises only 19% of the global market.

        <br>
        <br>

        Established in 2004 by civil society organizations and industry representatives, 
        the RSPO develops environmental and social criteria that minimize the negative 
        effects of oil palm production. 

        <br>
        <br>

        Since its inception, however, the RSPO has garnered criticism around weak standards, 
        limited enforcement, and a lack of sanctioning for non-compliance.  Several studies, 
        for example, note that palm oil certified by the RSPO is skewed toward plantations 
        in areas with few remaining forests—making them more likely to meet “no deforestation” targets. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        To optimize sustainability objectives, the RSPO should develop clear, quantitative targets, 
        measure performance relative to baseline conditions, and leverage remote sensing technology 
        for better monitoring and compliance. Such changes could potentially increase the cost of 
        Certified Palm Sustainable Oil, threatening to exclude small- and medium-scale producers from RSPO membership.
        
        <br>
        <br>

        In this way, it is imperative that reforms to the principles and criteria of the 
        RSPO incorporate greater guidance and support for smallholder farmers on meeting 
        the necessary requirements. Accompanied by rigorous enforcement, such reforms to 
        sustainable certification could contribute to the conservation of tropical forests 
        and limit the effects of oil palm production on global climate change.
